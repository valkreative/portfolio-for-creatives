# Loading A Random Logo with Pure JavaScript (Logo Array)

This is my attempt at loading random images with JavaScript. Now, I am still a novice when it comes to JavaScript so this is not an attempt to educate anybody. This is just me trying to apply JavaScript in real world scenarios. If there is any constructive criticism to share please do so. Please do not have professional level expectations and then bash me /my code. I'm still learning.
